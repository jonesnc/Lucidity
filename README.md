## About

This theme is based on the [Sanity](https://github.com/mdx97/Sanity) theme. Many thanks to `mdx97` for creating the foundation for this theme.

Sanity is a response to my own frustrations that were bred out of a long search for an optimal color theme for VSCode. I must have tried dozens, if not hundreds, of the most popular themes. None of them felt right to me.

In my opinion, most themes suffer from either being too "busy" (amount and contrast of colors), or from being too minimal (hardly any color at all). Themes that are too busy can make the code difficult to read deliberately. While themes that are too minimal can make the code difficult to skim. Both of which, I think, are important to every programmer.

## Design Philosophy

The overarching philosophy for Lucidity is pretty simple: make code easier to read. This philosophy is implemented in Lucidity in the following ways...

- Hues shaded to produce colors that optimally contrast (noticably different, but not too violent).
- Minimal number of colors in the palette.
- A neutral and easy to read baseline text color.

## What's new?

Lucidity adds some language-specific highlighting rules.
